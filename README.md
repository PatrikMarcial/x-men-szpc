## ðŸ“• About

**The project involves the creation of an interactive selector of X-Men dolls**. When you hover the mouse over each character, its image and description will automatically update. This will provide users with a dynamic and informative experience, allowing them to visually explore and learn more about each member of the X-Men in an intuitive way. This interactive approach adds an engaging element to the user experience, making character selection more engaging and informative. **Made with the help of the "DevEmDobro" intensive**
